# self-driving-car-path-planning

## Project Overview
### Project goal 
The goal of this project is to build a path planner that creates smooth, safe trajectories for the car to follow. The highway track has other vehicles, all going different speeds, but approximately obeying the 50 MPH speed limit.
### Solution overview
In general, it takes following 3 steps to solve path planning problem in self driving car technology. 
#### Step 1 - Prediction
**For each car in the highway, we need to do followings**:

#### Step 2 - Behaviour Planning
#### Step 3 - Trajectory Generation
